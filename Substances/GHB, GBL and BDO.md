# The Hole-y Trinity: GHB, GBL and BDO
## What is it?
![[Pasted image 20250713215540.png]]

There are three substances that are all referred to in the chemsex scene as "G".

### 1. GHB

First, we have **gamma-hydroxybutyric acid, or GHB**. This is a depressant drug that is often used alongside [[Methamphetamine|Tina]] for its counterbalancing effects, helping to take the edge off of T. It produces feelings of disinhibition, relaxation, euphoria, confidence, and increased libido—all properties that make it attractive for party and play. It can be thought of as the "main" substance in the trio, since both GBL and BDO are ultimately converted into GHB by your liver. It comes in the form of a colorless and odorless liquid that may have a slight salty or "soapy" taste.

> The salt form of GHB (known as sodium oxybate) is available as an FDA-approved medication for the treatment of narcolepsy. When used in this context it is safe and nontoxic to the body. Good luck getting any doctor to prescribe it, however.

GHB and its prodrugs, GBL and 1,4-butanediol (BD). While the latter two are ultimately converted into GHB in the body, each of these substances has distinct dosing guidelines, risks and durations. If someone offers you G, be sure that they know which of the three they have.

**GBL** is a prodrug that is metabolized into GHB. It has a quicker onset and produces a shorter, more intense high in comparison. Doses for GBL are also smaller, means there is

### What does a typical dose look like?

G comes in the form of a liquid and is typically dosed in milliliters. An oral syringe with precise markings is ideal, rather than something like a plastic pipette. 

While each of these three substances should be dosed differently due to their varying potencies, all of them are known for their slim safety margin. Basically, the difference between a great time and ruined night (or even death) can be as little as .1-.2 mL. 


> [!warning] Tips for Safer Dosing
> 1. Start with a smaller test dose, especially if you're trying out a new batch. Different batches are diluted differently. Additionally, your reaction will be influenced by factors like how much sleep you've had, when you last ate, and the presence of other substances in your body.
> 2. Set a timer when you dose and wait until it rings before you re-dose. At least an hour and 15 minutes is recommended, and two hours is even better (for GBL)

### Physical dependence

Any recreational drug (and many behaviors as well–gambling, sex, even the internet) can cause what is known as psychological dependence. This form of dependence is characterized by unpleasant emotional and motivational withdrawal symptoms that occur when someone stops using a particular substance.

Additionally, G can also produce what's known as physical dependence. This is true of other drugs that act on the same neurotransmitter, GABA, such as alcohol and benzodiazepines. In this case, the withdrawal that individuals experience is also characterized by physical symptoms. The acute phase of withdrawal can last anyway from days, weeks and, in some severe cases, months. After this, some individuals experience a protracted form of these symptoms that are generally less-severe, but can fluctuate unpredictably over time. This phenomenon is known as post-acute withdrawal syndrome, or PAWS, and can last anywhere from months to years. In some cases, individuals experience the symptoms in some form indefinitely.

The concept of dependence is part of, but distinct from the idea of addiction. One can be dependent on a substance without meeting the criteria for a substance use disorder. For many people on antidepressant drugs, for example, stopping medication cold turkey can produce an unpleasant set of symptoms that last for months and can interfere with one's ability hold a job or go to school.

Lastly, both forms of dependence involve physical changes in the brain's chemistry. Just because a drug only causes psychological dependence does not make it easier for someone to stop using.

Dependence to G can build quickly, and it's recommended that you only dose 3 times per week at most.

> Given the unpredictable nature of the illicit drug supply, there is always the possibility of unintended reactions from a contaminated batch of drugs.

### How can these risks be mitigated?

- Space out your use as much as possible. Tolerance to G builds quickly
- If you're dosing in the context of chemsex sessions, keep your use exclusive to that context. Don't start dosing to come down from stimulants or because you're bored.
