## What is it?

**Methamphetamine** (_N_-methylamphetamine) is a potent stimulant that is commonly sold on the street in its crystallized form.

> [!info]- How is meth different from Adderall (amphetamine)?
> Meth belongs to the amphetamine class of stimulant drugs, and the two substances have very similar structures and share many of the same subjective effects when consumed.
> 
> Meth contains an additional methyl group which makes it more lipophilic (lipid soluble) in comparison. This in turn means it can cross the blood-brain barrier more easily, which partially explains its increased potency compared to its parent compound.
> 
> The way meth is consumed also plays a large factor, since at least in the United States, amphetamine is only available in the form of a pill. As we discussed, the oral route is the least intense and longest lasting way of taking a drug. Even when amphetamine pills are crushed up and snorted, the amount of active drug entering the body is significantly limited by the presence of binders, which make up most of the pill's weight.
> In contrast, meth can be consumed many ways, with many individuals choosing to smoke it duet







It is related to amphetamine, but its slight structural difference makes it more lipophilic in comparison, allowing it to cross the blood-brain barrier[^5] more easily.

**Methamphetamine** (_N_-methylamphetamine)




**Methamphetamine** is a potent stimulant that is most commonly sold on the street in its crystallized form (hence *crystal meth*).[^1] It can be consumed [[Oral administration|orally]], [[Insufflation|snorted]], [[Inhalation|smoked]][^2], [[Rectal administration|booty bumped]], or [[Injection drug use|injected]]. Like all drugs, the way meth is consumed has an effect on its duration, intensity and associated risks.

## What does it feel like?

The subjective effects of meth that are often considered desirable include:

- increased energy and alertness
- increased focus (diminishes/becomes more "scattered" at higher doses)
- elevated mood
- increased sexual desire
- increased sociability (at low to moderate doses)
- reduced inhibitions (can lead to risk-taking behaviors)

Some effects are more neutral, or can become unwanted over time, such as:

- reduced need for sleep; insomnia
- reduced appetite
- dry mouth
- oily skin
- increased body temperature; sweating

Negative side effects include:

- agitation, aggression, irritability
- paranoia (and even psychosis)

Meth is known for producing a severe comedown, during which individuals can experience a variety of negative effects that can result in a compulsion to re-dose in order to provide relief.[^3] Some of these effects are:

- depression, increased suicidality
- hypersomnia, or an overwhelming need for sleep and inability to stay awake
- anxiousness, restlessness
- brain fog, difficulty concentrating
- headache

These symptoms generally last from a few days to a week, depending on the how much was consumed for how long. In chronic meth use, receptors in the brain have been damaged and altered, resulting in a post-acute withdrawal syndrome that can last from months to a year or more.
# Why are guys partying with meth?

> There‚Äôs as many reasons for using drugs as there are fingerprints on the planet.
> ‚Äì David Stuart

Everyone uses drugs for different reasons, and it wouldn't be feasible to create an exhaustive list of every possible reason one might have for getting high. What we can do is look at some of the more common reasons people might use in this specific context, which can hopefully bring us to a greater understanding of people who use drugs as those responding to a need.
## The positives

**Lowered inhibitions & increased libido.** Meth has a variety of effects which make it the ‚Äúideal‚Äù drug for men engaging in chemsex. Low to moderate doses of meth can dramatically increase sexual desire while lowering one's inhibitions. Many individuals experience discomfort or shame related to their sexuality resulting from negative body image, internalized stigma/homophobia, and anxiety about HIV, to name a few factors. For these folks, meth can facilitate sexual experiences free of these pressures.

**Long sessions.**
Meth‚Äôs ability to delay ejaculation, suppress appetite, increase energy, and alter our perception of time makes for the perfect companion to *long sessions* (one of the many euphemisms for chemsex used on hookup apps). The high from meth can result in an insatiable urge for *more*: more fucking, more drugs, more partners, more, more, more. Parties can go from hours to days when participants are re-dosing throughout the experience, with participants cycling in and out of the setting. In addition to being fun, this allows for a prolonged form of escapism for people looking to take a break from the real world.

## The negatives

The downside to using meth as a disinhibitor is that over time, individuals may find themselves unable to enjoy or even have sex without drugs. This can lead to a point where individuals want to slow down or stop partying altogether, but feel 

This relationship between sex and drugs can further complicate recovery for those who may want it. These individuals may find that traditional recovery resources don‚Äôt necessarily resonate with their experiences, since their problems are related to loneliness, societal pressures, and alienation as much as they‚Äôre related to what we traditionally conceive of as addiction. If someone feels that he has found community for the first time in his life through chemsex, how can we reasonably expect him to just give that up?

A strong body of research also shows us that these effects are linked to greater risk-taking, such as condomless sex, sex with multiple partners in a short time-frame, more extreme sex and  lower adherence to PrEP and ART. In general, stimulants like meth seem to cloud our ability to take the future into account when making decisions.

It also increases libido and delays ejaculation. This, in combination with meth's ability to suppress the need for food and sleep, is why it's not uncommon to see party and play sessions last upwards of 10-20 hours or even days. Combined with lower rates of condom usage, these longer sessions can result in small tears and abrasions that greatly increase the risk of STI transmission from sex. 

Speaking anecdotally, the increased sexual desire provided by meth is different from the feelings of connectedness and openness associated with drugs like MDMA, sometimes referred to as empathogens. The pleasure-seeking one experiences during a meth high feels more physical in nature, almost feral.

This is not the only party drug that has an [FDA-approved formulation](https://www.fda.gov/drugs/postmarket-drug-safety-information-patients-and-providers/xyrem-sodium-oxybate-information).
