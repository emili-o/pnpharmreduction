The way that a drug is consumed, also known as the **route of administration** (ROA), can greatly influence how it affects someone. Some drugs can only be effectively administered via one or two ROAs, like [[GHB, GBL and BDO|GHB, GBL and BDO]]. Other drugs offer many options for administration, as is the case with [[Methamphetamine|meth]].

First, let's look at the properties of a drug's effects that are influenced by the ROA:
- **Bioavailability** — This term describes the amount of a drug that actually reaches circulation in the body.
- **Onset** — This is the length of time it takes for the drug's effects to become noticeable.
- **Duration** — This is the length of the overall experience.
- **Intensity** — This is fairly self-explanatory. It's important to understand that a more rapid onset = shorter duration = greater intensity.
- **Risk** — The same drug can pose varying levels of risk depending on the ROA.

## The Oral Route

- When consumed orally, drugs undergo a process known as first-pass metabolism. Once consumed, drugs are metabolized at various points in the body before reaching circulation. 

## Smoking/Vaporization
- While there are many drugs that people straight-up combust and inhale the resulting smoke of, the smokable drugs used in party scenes are all technically vaporized. This ROA provides a rapid onset, since the large surface area of the lungs are coated with receptors. This generally provides a more immediate "rush" than one would get from swallowing or even snorting the drug, though the tradeoff for this increased intensity is a shorter overall experience.
- In the case of drugs like [[Methamphetamine|meth]], the initial "rush" can wear off long before the overall experience is over. Individuals may be tempted to recreate this initial sensation by smoking more, which generally fails to reproduce that euphoric wave and can result in people consuming more than they intended and experiencing more negative side effects. This process is referred to as "compulsive redosing", and it's one of the reasons smoking is seen as particularly habit-forming.
