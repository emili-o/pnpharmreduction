**PrEP**, short for Pre-Exposure Prophylaxis[^1], is the use of antiretroviral medications by HIV-negative people who are at a higher risk of infection[^2]. When taken as prescribed, PrEP reduces the chances of HIV transmission via sex by around 99%, and about 74% for transmission via injection drug use.

It's an evidence-based method of HIV prevention that involves taking medications—the same medications used for the treatment of HIV—by people who are HIV-negative but may be at risk for an infection. It is 92-99% effective in preventing infection, and when combined with modern antiretroviral therapies that can prevent someone living with an infection to transmit it to sexual partners, PrEP is a game-changer in the fight against HIV.

**PrEP** comes in two main forms: **pills** and **long-acting injectables**. We'll cover both, but which one is right for you is a personal choice based on your own circumstances. Your doctor or PrEP navigator can help you make the best decision for you.

Even if you do not feel you fall into the high-risk category, your provider should prescribe PrEP if you feel you could benefit from it.
