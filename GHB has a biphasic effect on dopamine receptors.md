**GHB** has a biphasic dose-response curve, which means that its effects can differ between low and high doses. Though its considered a depressant drug, lower doses of G can be stimulating, inducing a feeling of euphoria, sociability and disinhibition. Higher doses are associated with more typical depressant effects—sedation, drowsiness, dizziness, impaired memory and loss of consciousness.

> High doses of G can induce coma and respiratory depression. This can be especially fatal if G is combined with other depressant drugs like alcohol, benzos, opioids and even ketamine. Combining these drugs is never advised. If you’ve had alcohol and are adamant about dosing, be sure to allow at least one hour per drink for your body to process it.

This effect happens because of the way that G acts on different receptors in the central nervous system. Lower doses of G bind to the GHB receptors and stimulate the release of dopamine. Higher doses bind to the GABA-B receptors, initially inhibiting the release of dopamine. After this initial period, dopamine release is actually increased via the GHB receptors
